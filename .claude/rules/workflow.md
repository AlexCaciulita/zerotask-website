# Workflow Rules

At the start of every session, read `memory/status.md` to pick up where we left off.

Before the session ends, update `memory/status.md` with current progress:
- What was completed
- What's in progress
- What comes next
- Any blockers or open questions

Always check `CLAUDE.md` for project context and architectural decisions before making changes.
